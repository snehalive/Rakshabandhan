      <p>
        Raksha Bandhan is a festival that is celebrated on the full moon day in
        the month of Shravan according to the Hindu Lunar calendar. This day is
        observed as the day of siblings as on this day sisters and brothers come
        together to express their love for each other and also pray for their
        well being. The sisters tie a knot of rakhi on the wrist of her brother,
        who promises to protect his sister from the evil. Today, this festival
        is not only celebrated among the siblings, but also between friends and
        the close ones to whom the people want to spread their message of love
        and care.
